# Jstags template repo
Jstags are customer-specific or website-specific integrations with Adhese SDK. This repo manages the code and release workflow for such integrations.

## How to start working with it
1. Fork the repo to your own organisation (we recommend renaming the forked repo to "jstags")
2. Give `adhese-ci` github user access to the forked repo

## Adding a new customer jstag
1. Create a new customer dir under `customers`, create a file structure similar to `customers/customerx`
2. Notify the Adhese team when you're ready to take it live
